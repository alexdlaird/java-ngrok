`java-ngrok` is a Java wrapper for `ngrok` that manages its own binary, making `ngrok` available via a convenient Java
API.

[`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com) is a reverse proxy tool that opens secure tunnels from public URLs to localhost, perfect for
exposing local web servers, building webhook integrations, enabling SSH access, testing chatbots, demoing from your own
machine, and more, and its made even more powerful with native Java integration through `java-ngrok`.

## Installation

`java-ngrok` is available
on [Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/).

If we want `ngrok` to be available from the command line, [pyngrok](https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok) can be
installed using `pip` to manage that for us.

## Basic Usage

All `ngrok` functionality is available through
the [`NgrokClient`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/NgrokClient.html). To open a tunnel, use
the [`connect`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/NgrokClient.html#connect(com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok.protocol.CreateTunnel))
method, which returns a `Tunnel`, and this returned object has a reference to the public URL generated by `ngrok`, which
can be retrieved with [`getPublicUrl()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/protocol/Tunnel.html#getPublicUrl()).

```java
final NgrokClient ngrokClient = new NgrokClient.Builder().build();

// Open a HTTP tunnel on the default port 80
// <Tunnel: "https://<public_sub>.ngrok.io" -> "http://localhost:80">
final Tunnel httpTunnel = ngrokClient.connect();

// Open a SSH tunnel
// <Tunnel: "tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345" -> "localhost:22">
final CreateTunnel sshCreateTunnel = new CreateTunnel.Builder()
        .withProto(Proto.TCP)
        .withAddr(22)
        .build();
final Tunnel sshTunnel = ngrokClient.connect(sshCreateTunnel);

// Open a named tunnel from the config file
final CreateTunnel createNamedTunnel = new CreateTunnel.Builder()
        .withName("my_tunnel_name")
        .build();
final Tunnel namedTunnel = ngrokClient.connect(createNamedTunnel);
```

The [`connect`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/NgrokClient.html#connect(com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok.protocol.CreateTunnel))
method can also take
a [`CreateTunnel`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/protocol/CreateTunnel.html) (which can be built
through [its Builder](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/protocol/CreateTunnel.Builder.html))
that allows us to pass additional properties that are [supported by `ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/reference/config/#tunnel-definitions).

Assuming we have also installed [pyngrok](https://github.com/alexdlaird/pyngrok), all features of `ngrok` are available
on the command line.

```sh
ngrok http 80
```

For details on how to fully leverage `ngrok` from the command line,
see [`ngrok`'s official documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs).

## Documentation

### `ngrok` Version Compatibility

`java-ngrok` is compatible with `ngrok` v2 and v3, but by default it will install v3. To install v2 instead,
set the version with [`JavaNgrokConfig.Builder.withNgrokVersion(NgrokVersion)`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/conf/JavaNgrokConfig.Builder.html#withNgrokVersion(com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok.installer.NgrokVersion))
and [`CreateTunnel.Builder.withNgrokVersion(NgrokVersion)`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/latest/com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok/com/github/alexdlaird/ngrok/protocol/CreateTunnel.Builder.html#withNgrokVersion(com.github.alexdlaird.ngrok.installer.NgrokVersion)).

### Java 8

[![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/alexdlaird/java-ngrok/build.yml?branch=1.4.x)](https://github.com/alexdlaird/java-ngrok/actions/workflows/build.yml?query=branch%3A1.4.x)

Java 8 support is not actively maintained, but on a periodic basis, `main` may be rebased in to the `1.4.x`
branch, where a compatible build of this project does exist for Java 8. To use it, include the `java8-ngrok`
dependency from [Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.alexdlaird/java8-ngrok/).

The [Process API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessHandle.html) was introduced in Java 9, so  certain convenience methods around managing
the `ngrok` process are not available in the Java 8 build. For instance, without the Process API,
`java8-ngrok` cannot teardown the external `ngrok` process for us. So even though the Java process
will terminate gracefully, `ngrok` will not. On a Unix-like system, we can remedy this with:

```java
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
    try {
        // Java 8 doesn't properly manage its child processes, so ensure it's killed
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec("killall -9 ngrok");
    } catch (final IOException e) {
        LOG.error("An error occurred while shutting down ngrok", e);
    }
}));
```

But `killall` is not available on all platforms, and even on Unix-like systems this workaround is
is limited and has side effects.
